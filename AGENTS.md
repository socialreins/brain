# AGENTS.md: brain

The Rust backend for SocialReins. Project overview and install docs live in
[socialreins/web](https://github.com/socialreins/web). The Laravel app it
replaces (`~/Code/social-media-manager`) is a read-only reference: read it, never change it.

## Run

```sh
docker compose up -d postgres
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://brain:brain@localhost:5432/socialreins_brain
export MAIL_LOG=true   # sign-in links go to the log
cargo fmt --check && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
cargo run -p socialreins-brain
```

## Layout

- `app/`: Axum shell. `controllers/` parse and respond, `models/` hold SeaORM entities,
  `config.rs` reads every env var (defaults live there and only there), `mail.rs` sends mail.
- `app/migration/`: one file per migration, raw SQL, registered in `lib.rs`. Applied on boot.
- `crates/*`: framework-free domain code. Never depend on `axum` or `sea-orm` there.
- `/v1` routes carry `utoipa::path` annotations; `/openapi.json` is generated from them.

## Rules

- No em dashes in any text: code, comments, docs, commit messages, PR bodies. Use a comma, a
  colon or two sentences. CI fails on one.
- Ship through a pull request with green CI. No direct pushes to `main`.
- Never force-push.
- Never commit or log secrets. `.env` is gitignored; `Config` has no `Debug` because
  `DATABASE_URL` holds a password.
- Logging is `tracing` only. Clippy denies `println!`, `eprintln!`, `dbg!`, `todo!` and
  `unimplemented!` workspace-wide.
- Every new endpoint gets a request test in `app/tests/` against a real Postgres.
- Copy patterns from the owner's other Rust API (OpsAgentDev/opsagent-brain), not its features.
